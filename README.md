For this project we were taksed with building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using JavaScript, Plotly.JS, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask. The data was read from CSV files using Pandas. Interactive charts were constructed using Plotly.js. 

The final Flask application was deployed to Heroku at the following link: https://belly-button-jill.herokuapp.com/
